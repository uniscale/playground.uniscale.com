<summary>Introduction to specification</summary>

A functional specification is a formal document used to describe a product's intended capabilities, appearance, and interactions with users. The functional specification is the accumulated knowledge behind the decisions taken in the process of building the solution. Itâ€™s a guideline and continuing reference point for the evolution of your solution.

Typically included:

* Functional requirements.
* High level business requirements..
* Abstract description of your solution.

### High level specification

<details>

<summary>Introduction to high level specification</summary>

This is where you will specify the overall idea that you have.

This includes an introduction to your idea, what the actual challenge is, why are you going to solve this, and on a high level your approach to solving this.

This is typically defined by the founder, visionary, or product owner who has the overall understanding of the idea.

This part is done from an abstract view, meaning that it is not about solving the actual problem, but rather carefully explain what the problem is and what the desired outcome is.

</details>

1. Create solution
2. Describe specification in your solution description
   1. Abstract specification
   2. Purpose and motivation
   3. High level requirements
   4. High level end user behavior
3. Create modules
   1. Description
   2. Functional use case
   3. Acceptance criteria

**Next steps:**

* Approve module revision
* Optional: Generate SDK
* Invite relevant stakeholders
  * Input for high level specification
  * To continue with detailed specification

This is where you will start to design how the actual product will look and feel like. Should it be an app, website, software, a combination, or just a paper? Describing the intended user experience How should the user interface look and feel?

This is where you will involve a product designer (eg. UX/UI designer) who will start to break down the high level specification and design the product.

Where the first part is abstract, here you will define concretely how the product will work: Pages and sections: The overall layout of your product including visuals (mocks or wireframes), Use cases and criteria: How exactly the product should work - For example what pages you will need, what buttons to include, what should happen when clicking on each button, and what should happens in case of errors?

</details>

1. Invite relevant stakeholder; Product designer, UX designer, or UI designer.
2. Describe your detailed specification
   1. Concrete user interface
   2. UX requirements
   3. UI requirements
3.
