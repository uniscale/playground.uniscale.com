| Specification         | A detailed document outlining specific requirements, features, behaviors, and constraints of a software project. In Uniscale, this is divided into a Functional Specification, defining how the end-user application should work, and a Technical Specification, specifying requirements for implemented functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| UI flows              | Represent the specification of a single behavior in an end-user application, such as clicking a button or expanding/hiding elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Use case              | A detailed description or scenario illustrating how a system, software application, or product is used by actors. In Uniscale, a use case is a grouping of functionality within a single service, providing specific functionality to parts of the end-user application for specific reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Value object          | Is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity. In general, two value objects are considered equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object (e.g., objects representing an amount of money or a date range). In Uniscale, a value object is a data structure uniquely identified by its data alone. For example, if two data objects representing addresses have identical data, they are known to be equal and interchangeable. This is in contrast to aggregates, which are only comparable through their identifier. |
