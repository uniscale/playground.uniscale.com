# (NEW) Uniscale Glossary

This is to provide a clear definition of these terms so customers can navigate Uniscale and clearly understand what a specific term refers to:



| Term           | Uniscale Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggregate      | A grouped collections of data elements or objects based on certain criteria, are often used in databases and data analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Data property  | A data characteristics or attributes, such as type, format, and structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dependency     | A list of external factors or elements that an item relies on for successful completion. In Uniscale, these are often termed "Intra-service dependencies," involving dependencies between features, covering data properties up to UI flows.                                                                            |
| Namespace      | A targeted subject area of a computer program, used in software engineering. In Uniscale, it is used to represent different areas within a service hierarchically, preventing a long, unmanageable list of features and data objects.                                                                                   |
| Endpoint       | A specific function, capability, or characteristic of a product or software application. In Uniscale, a feature defines a specific instance of a function within an API, instructing a service to perform actions based on past data or retrieved information.                                                          |
| SDK Library    | Collections of pre-written code, functions, or modules used to simplify software development. In Uniscale, libraries are autogenerated in the CoLab offering.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Property       | A named value associated with an object (e.g., 'Age' for the object Human).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Property group | Grouping or categorizing related properties or attributes within a data structure or class. In Uniscale, property groups are data structures consisting only of properties from other aggregates and value objects, particularly when features require combined data.                                                   |
| Revision       | The action of revising. Revisions are iterative copies of the previous version with changes, including additions, removals, edits, or expansions.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Service        | A type of software component or function that performs specific tasks or operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Solution       | A software-based answer to a specific problem or need often involves the design and implementation of software components or applications. In Uniscale, a solution represents a full technical system, owning data used across multiple services even though the service is the one storing it.                         |
| Specification  | A detailed document outlining specific requirements, features, behaviors, and constraints of a software project. In Uniscale, this is divided into a Functional Specification, defining how the end-user application should work, and a Technical Specification, specifying requirements for implemented functionality. |
| UI flow        | Represent the specification of a single behavior in an end-user application, such as clicking a button or expanding/hiding elements.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Use case       | A detailed description or scenario illustrating how a system, software application, or product is used by actors.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Value object   | Is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity. In general, two value objects are considered equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object (e.g., objects representing an amount of money or a date range).                                     |
