# (NEW) Uniscale Glossary

This is to provide a clear definition of these terms so customers can navigate Uniscale and clearly understand what a specific term refers to:



## In alphabetical order

### Acceptance criteria&#x20;

### Admin&#x20;

**(TBA)** A user with elevated privileges who manages platform settings, user accounts, permissions, and projects.

### Aggregate

A grouped collections of data elements or objects based on certain criteria are often used in databases and data analysis.&#x20;

### Bounded context&#x20;

### Data

### Data property&#x20;

A data characteristics or attributes, such as type, format, and structure.

### DDD Domain

**(TBA)** The problem area or subject matter that the solution built in Uniscale addresses. It encompasses the core concepts and rules of a particular business or problem space. DDD focuses on understanding and modeling the domain to create software that accurately reflects real-world concepts and behaviors.

### Dependency&#x20;

A list of external factors or elements that an item relies on for successful completion. In Uniscale, these are often termed "Intra-service dependencies," involving dependencies between features, covering data properties up to UI flows.

### Designer note

**(TBA)** Annotations provided by the UI designer and product lead for each User Interface (UI) element. They describe the intended functionality and any constraints envisioned for that part of the UI. These notes serve as guidelines for developers and ensure consistency in implementing the UI design.

### Documentation

**(TBA)** Set of written materials, guidelines, and instructions that provide information about various aspects of a project or solution. This includes technical documentation, which describes the architecture, design, and implementation details of the solution, as well as functional documentation, which outlines the features, requirements, and use cases of the project.

### Endpoints

A specific function, capability, or characteristic of a product or software application. In Uniscale, a feature defines a specific instance of a function within an API, instructing a service to perform actions based on past data or retrieved information.

### Functional use case&#x20;

**(TBA)** A description outlining the high-level functionality provided to the end user within a project or solution. It defines specific interactions or scenarios that users can perform to achieve desired outcomes, focusing on the functionality delivered to the user from a user's perspective

### Implementation&#x20;

### Module&#x20;

### Namespaces&#x20;

A targeted subject area of a computer program, used in software engineering. In Uniscale, it is used to represent different areas within a service hierarchically, preventing a long, unmanageable list of features and data objects.

### Owner&#x20;

### Pages

### Product&#x20;

### Property&#x20;

A named value associated with an object (e.g., 'Age' for the object Human).

### Property Group&#x20;

Grouping or categorizing related properties or attributes within a data structure or class. In Uniscale, property groups are data structures consisting only of properties from other aggregates and value objects, particularly when features require combined data.

### Revision&#x20;

The action of revising. Revisions are iterative copies of the previous version with changes, including additions, removals, edits, or expansions.

### SDK Languages&#x20;

### SDK Library

Collections of pre-written code, functions, or modules used to simplify software development. In Uniscale, libraries are autogenerated in the offering.

### Section

### Service&#x20;

A type of software component or function that performs specific tasks or operations.

### Service flow&#x20;

### Solution&#x20;

A software-based answer to a specific problem or need often involves the design and implementation of software components or applications. In Uniscale, a solution represents a full technical system, owning data used across multiple services even though the service is the one storing it.

### Specification

A detailed document outlining specific requirements, features, behaviors, and constraints of a software project. In Uniscale, this is divided into a Functional Specification, defining how the end-user application should work, and a Technical Specification, specifying requirements for implemented functionality.

### Technical intentions&#x20;

### UI flow&#x20;

Represent the specification of a single behavior in an end-user application, such as clicking a button or expanding/hiding elements.

### Use case&#x20;

A detailed description or scenario illustrating how a system, software application, or product is used by actors.&#x20;

### Use case flow&#x20;

### User&#x20;

### UX flow&#x20;

### Value object&#x20;

Is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity. In general, two value objects are considered equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object (e.g., objects representing an amount of money or a date range).&#x20;

### Version&#x20;

### Workspace&#x20;
