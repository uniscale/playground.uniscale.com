# Tutorial: Using comments

Comments in Uniscale serve the purpose of facilitating communication and collaboration among team members. They allow users to offer feedback, pose questions, and share insights related to specific elements within a solution, including modules, pages, or functional use cases.



### What is the comments feature?

Comments are textual messages users use to annotate and discuss different aspects of a solution.&#x20;

They may contain feedback, suggestions, questions, or clarifications about specific elements within a Solution. Furthermore, users can tag specific individuals in their comments to grab their attention or seek their input.

{% tabs %}

Highlight the text you want to comment on, then click “Comment”. A box will appear on the right-hand side where you can write your comment. Once you're done, simply press Send to share your comment.
