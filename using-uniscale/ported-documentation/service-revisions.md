# (PORTED) Service revisions

## Introduction to process

Within the cycles of modeling and producing well-written documentation, you will find yourself completing items and getting them to a stage where you can lock things in place before a revision.

To do so in a better manner, we have provided each item in your documentation with its lifecycle related to its meaning.



For that, we distinguish between :

* "items" that are to be reused ( endpoints, data contracts, properties )
* items that are single declarations ( namespaces, Use case flows, Technical use cases)

As a whole, a service has revisions and is approved. This is symbolized via the revisions dropdown where you can see a list of your past revisions titles and numbers.



Listing the structure of a service, we can have ( for a more detailed breakdown, read [here](service-basics.md))

* namespaces
* technical use cases
* use case flows
* endpoints
* data contracts
  * aggregates
  * value objects
  * property groups&#x20;
  * properties

Each of them is subjected to a lifecycle, with different meanings.

## Processes

### Completion cycle

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-04-10 at 10.51.52.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Endpoints, data contracts and properties are considered items that are agnostic of the entire status of the service. As a whole, they can be "completed" before the overall approval status and as such, their cycle reflects their state of being "done" or "completed".

Exploring step by step the process, we have :

* When a new item is created, it is in the status of "**`draft`**"
* Afterward, with new changes done, it goes into "**`edited`**"
* Once all the conditions are met, the item can be "**`completed`**"
* Once completed, the item can be **`"opened"`** to new changes
* If some changes are made, then the item is moved back into **`"Edited"`**

### Lockable cycle

Namespaces, technical use case flows and use case flows are all process items that are relevant to what the end goal of the service is. As such, rather than a completion intention, they have a "is this final", or "is this locked" cycle.



Exploring step by step the process, we have :&#x20;

* When a new item is created, it has the status of **`"edited"`**
* once all requirements are met, it can now be **`"marked as ready"`**
* When the owning module is **`Approved`**, all items are moved to **`"locked"`**
* Later, when a new revision is made, all items are still in **`"locked"`**
* From here, one can manually **`"unlock"`** the items that are intended for changes, and move them to **`"unlocked"`**
* If any change is made to a **`"unlocked"`** item, it gets automatically moved to the status **`"edited"`**

## Approval of the service & revisions

Service approval is a collation of all the above processes and loops. Let's take a conceptual example of that scenario, with images to visually represent the state at all times.

1. In the start, the service grows to a stage where various items will be in either the **`"locking lane"`** or the **`"completion lane"`** . This is further expanded with dependencies between the 2 types, in our example in a simple, upwards dependencies manner.

2. As things progress in the service modeling, all items are now **`completed`** and the process items are **`ready to be locked.`**

3. With everything in place, the service has now been approved, and Revision 1.0 has been created. This means all items are moved to **`locked`** state and the others remain **`completed`**.

4. From here on, of course, the service will grow towards a new revision, and to initiate one, the service will need to be opened, and various items will be **`unlocked.`** As such, all items that are downward dependencies of such item will be marked as **`Opened`**, marking the intent to add changes. Once changes are made, the cycle goes back to step 1 in this guide.

## Revisions

Revisions represent changes done to your service with the intent to release functionality around your projects. Revisions can be as big or as small as you need.&#x20;

In the interface, any revision looks like the following:

Each revision will be given a name when created and a description. This can be edited until the revision is approved at the end.

### Service timeline

Over time the service will receive many revisions, all needed incremental changes. This is expected and is a sign of an ever-growing service (in quality and overview of usage, and not primarily in size).
